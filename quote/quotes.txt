One of the fundamental problems is that security is very hard. And what makes it hard is that it's a negative deliverable. You really don't know when you have it. You only find out belatedly when you've lost it. -- Jeff Schiller (Network Manager at MIT)
"The mark of an immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause, while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one." --W. Stekel

common programmer thought pattern: there are only three numbers: 0, 1, and n. -- Joel Spolsky (User Interface Design for Programmers, Ch 7).
Only failure makes us experts. -- Theo de Raadt
If you look at software today, through the lens of the history of engineering, it's certainly engineering of a sort - but it's the kind of engineering that people without the concept of the arch did.  Most software today is very much like an Egyptian pyramid with millions of bricks piled on top of each other, with no structural integrity, but just done by brute force and thousands of slaves. -- Alan Kay, ACM Queue, Vol 2. No. 9
Occupying a third place in human intellectual culture, computing is not bound by the need to describe what does exist (as in natural science) or what can be built in the real world (as in engineering). -- John Crowcroft, Communications of the ACM, Vol 48. No. 2
When a stupid man is doing something is he ashamed of, he always declares that it is his duty. -- George Bernard Shaw
When you hear voices in your head that tell you to shoot the pope, do you do what they say? Same thing goes for customers and managers. They are the crazy voices in your head, and you need to set them right, not just blindly do what they ask for. -- Linus Torvalds

"Ideas are a dime a dozen.  It's execution that counts." -- Frank Herbert
"There are only two hard things in CS: cache invalidation and naming things." -- Phil Karlton
Free software is part of a broader phenomenon, which is a shift toward recognizing the value of shared work. Historically, shared stuff had a very bad name. The reputation was that people always abused shared things, and in the physical world, something that is shared and abused becomes worthless. In the digital world, I think we have the inverse effect, where something that is shared can become more valuable than something that is closely held, as long as it is both shared and contributed to by everybody who is sharing in it. -- Mark Shuttleworth
This is an important part of the Internet Dynamic ' providing opportunity and not guarantees. -- Bob Frankston
"knowledge workers" are simply those people whose job consists of having interesting conversations. -- The Cluetrain Manifesto. Page 123.

"Don't change the man. Change his environment."	-- Buckminster Fuller
Money corrupts the process of reasoning. -- Lawrense Lessig
Most of us human beings tend to be parochial in our perceptions. What happens is that we have a very limited and narrow view of our self interest and do not adequately weight the price that has to be paid on the other side for any of these measures we are promoting. -- Alan Borovoy on CBC's Cross Country Checkup (2008-03-09)
If you want to create new markets, or disrupt old ones, you create ubiquitous infrastructure. -- Doc Searls

ideas that change business models and who can make money are the most threatening, outside actual religion. - John Day (Patterns in Network Architecture)
Failure does not bring with it a better chance for future success. It brings a trimming of future ambitions.
Everything is vague to a degree you do not realize till you have tried to make it precise. -- Bertrand Russell
Always be a 1st-rate version of yourself, instead of a 2nd-rate version of somebody else. -- Garland
I realized the reason I had a lot of stress in the corporate environment is because I didn't fit in that environment, I came to understand that my real passion is getting things done in ways that probably aren't always acceptable in a corporate setting, like saying what's on your mind, actually telling people when you think they're going about something the wrong way, and trying to help them find a better way to do it. -- Brett Schklar
The way to grow is to do what you love to do. Invest in it. Build it. Be willing to take risks. Keep ethics and the best interests of the people around you in mind. And don't always focus on the money. -- Brett Schklar
As we benefit from the inventions of others, we should be glad to share our own ... freely and gladly." -- Franklin
"If you want to succeed, double your failure rate." -- Thomas Watson.
Stop agonizing about what's not working. Instead, ask yourself, 'What's working well, right now, and how can I do more of it?' -- Chip and Dan Heath, What matters now, Pg 50
If you keep thinking about putting on a conference or being a Hollywood screenwriter, and you find the idea terrifies but intrigues you, it's probably a worthy endeavor for you.  You grow (and thrive!) by doing what excites you and what scares you everyday, not by trying to find your passion. -- Derek Sivers, What matters now, Pg 51
Declare war on passivity. Hush the inner voice that insists you're over the hill, past your prime, unworthy of attaining those dreams. Disbelief is now the enemy, as is the notion of settling. Get hungry ' hyena hungry. Get fired up. Find your backbone, and your wings. Flap 'em. It's the only way you'll be able to fly. -- J.C. Hutchins, What matters now, Pg 81
Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter. -- Martin Luther King Jr
Being negative is easy. There will always be a downside to everything good, a hurdle to everything desirable, a con to every pro. The real courage is in finding the good in what you have, the opportunities in every hurdle, the pros in every con. -- Carolyn Hax
Until one is committed, there is hesitancy, the chance to draw back-- Concerning all acts of initiative (and creation), there is one elementary truth that ignorance of which kills countless ideas and splendid plans: that the moment one definitely commits oneself, then Providence moves too. All sorts of things occur to help one that would never otherwise have occurred. A whole stream of events issues from the decision, raising in one's favor all manner of unforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance, which no man could have dreamed would have come his way. Whatever you can do, or dream you can do, begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it. Begin it now. -- Goethe (http://www.goethesociety.org/pages/quotescom.html)
Then indecision brings its own delays, And days are lost lamenting over lost days. Are you in earnest? Seize this very minute; What you can do, or dream you can do, begin it; Boldness has genius, power and magic in it. -- http://www.goethesociety.org/pages/quotescom.html

Making your mark on the world is hard. If it were easy, everybody would do it. But it's not. It takes patience, it takes commitment, and it comes with plenty of failure along the way. The real test is not whether you avoid this failure, because you won't. It's whether you let it harden or shame you into inaction, or whether you learn from it; whether you choose to persevere." -- President Barack Obama
Ignorance: the root of all evil. -- Plato
Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle. -- Plato
The price good men pay for indifference to publiuc affairs is to be ruled by evil men. -- Plato
When a respected information source covers something where you have on-the-ground experience, the result is often to make you wonder how much fecal matter you've swallowed in areas outside your own expertise. -- Rusty Russell
Any time someone puts a lock on something that belongs to you, and won't give you a key, they're not doing it for your benefit. -- Doctorow's First Law

Architecture trumps licensing any time. -- Tim O'Reilly
When the complexity of the problems humans must solve exceeds the capability of our brains, we turn to beliefs. -- Rebecca Costa (http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-10-13/global-warming-denial-explained-by-rebecca-costa-/)

When you have lots of ideas it's like: how can I get people to steal this idea and do it? But when you have very few... -- Jay Rosen (@jayrosen_nyu)
Luck is probability taken personally.
The signature of mediocrity is not an unwillingness to change. The signature of mediocrity is inconsistency. -- Jim Collins
Pure academic research and applied industrial research are complementary, and should be pursued concurrently and in collaboration. The goal of industrial research is (and should always be) to pluck the 'low-hanging fruit'; that is, to solve the easiest parts of the most prevalent problems, in the particular circumstances of here and now. But the goal of the pure research scientist is exactly the opposite: it is to construct the most general theories, covering the widest possible range of phenomena, and to seek certainty of knowledge that will endure for future generations. It is to avoid the compromises so essential to engineering, and to seek ideals like accuracy of measurement, purity of materials, and correctness of programs, far beyond the current perceived needs of industry or popularity in the market-place. For this reason, it is only scientific research that can prepare mankind for the unknown unknowns of the forever uncertain future. -- C.A.R. Hoare (http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2009/10/42360-retrospective-an-axiomatic-basis-for-computer-programming/fulltext)
Secrecy can spring from the best motives; but as it grows it begins to exist only for itself, only for its own sake, only to cover its own abuses. -- Senator Chris Dodd

Get a good idea, and stay with it. Dog it, and work at it until it's done, and done right. -- Walt Disney
It is easier to move a problem around (for example, by moving the problem to a different part of the overall network architecture) than it is to solve it. -- RFC 1925
The significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them. -- Einstein

There are decades when nothing happens... And there are weeks when decades happen. -- Vladimir Ilyich Lenin
When you adopt a tool you adopt the management philosophy embedded in that tool. -- Clay Shirky (Ted Talk - How the Internet will (one day) transform government)
The ability to master complexity is not the same as the ability to extract simplicity. -- S. Shenker
 Rule 1. You can't tell where a program is going to spend its time.  Bottlenecks occur in surprising places, so don't try to second guess and put in a speed hack until you've proven that's where the bottleneck is. -- Rob Pike
Rule 2. Measure. Don't tune for speed until you've measured, and even then don't unless one part of the code overwhelms the rest.
Rule 3. Fancy algorithms are slow when n is small, and n is usually small. Fancy algorithms have big constants. Until you know that n is frequently going to be big, don't get fancy. (Even if n does get big, use Rule 2 first.) -- Rob Pike
Rule 4. Fancy algorithms are buggier than simple ones, and they're much harder to implement. Use simple algorithms as well as simple data structures. -- Rob Pike
Rule 5. Data dominates. If you've chosen the right data structures and organized things well, the algorithms will almost always be self-evident. Data structures, not algorithms, are central to programming. -- Rob Pike
The computer industry is the only industry that is more fashion-driven than women’s fashion. -- Larry Ellison
In Smalltalk, everything happens somewhere else. -- Adele Goldberg'
