* Name
  Quotes
* What
  - Small script to put  quotes from different sources to a file.
  - Small script to display one random quote from a file.
* Why?
  This should clearly be a fortune file, but I wanted to try factor,
  so there it is. One line per quote and word wrap.

  There's also a shell version, because it's not a big deal
* How
  There's a binary to display a random line (formatted to 40
  chars). The code is in factor, and it's accessible also.

  The generation of the quotes file is a combination of cli apps and
  pipes.

* Bugs
  Already after 5 minutes of trying it, The unbalancing of quotes
  proived by the different 3 sources makes the bigger one dominant, so
  if I really want to get things from the others, I better read them
  straight from the source. :)
